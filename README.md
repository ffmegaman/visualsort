# Visual Sort

This is a simple visualization of the Bubble Sort algorithm. In this model, the algorithm works with an array that contains randomly generated numbers and sorts a set of two numbers at a time. If the number on the right is larger than the number on the left, the algorithm will switch them before moving on one place to the right. Each time the whole array has been examined, and the largest number has been switched to the furthest right, the next round will be examined with one less element.

Finally, the numbers are visualized as the pixel height of blue sticks in the html page. Enjoy!
